# Make-an-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-Car
In a recent session, we showed you how to build an Arduino-powered robot car that we controlled using Bluetooth. This time, we’ll take our setup a step further by giving the car the ability to detect obstacles in its path and course-correct automatically, using a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor and a bit of smart code.  Prerequisites: —Basic knowledge of Arduino Programming —Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)  Hardware required: —Arduino UNO —Servo Motors, Ultrasonic sensors &amp; Chassis —L298N Motor Driver Shield  -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Social media: —Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings —Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings —Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #Arduino #DIY
